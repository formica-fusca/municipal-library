/**
 * The identity of an Entity.
 *
 * Identity is the single trait that separates an Entity from a Value Object.
 * Two copies of "Dune" with identical titles, authors and publication years are
 * *different books* if they carry different barcodes — and the same book if
 * they carry the same one, even after one has been rebound and no longer
 * matches its former description.
 *
 * ## Why a class and not a bare `string`
 *
 * A `string` id is assignable to any other `string` id. Nothing stops
 * `checkOut(memberId, titleId)` being called as `checkOut(titleId, memberId)`.
 * Subclasses of `Identifier` declare a distinct `_tag`, which makes them
 * mutually unassignable at compile time. The `declare` modifier means the field
 * exists only in the type system — it emits no JavaScript and costs nothing at
 * runtime.
